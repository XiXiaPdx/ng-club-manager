# Student Attendance

This is an Angular 2 CLI web application for Epicodus code school Friday assignment.  

## Planning

This one went south pretty quickly. A lot to say about it. Summary, it didn't go well and there are tons of areas for improvement here.  Simply ran out of time and was not able to put it together.

# Technologies

Angular 2, TypeScript, JavaScript, Jquery, HTML5, CSS
 [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) for front-end css frameworks.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following software properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)

## Installation

Perform the following  steps at your terminal prompt

* #### Enter the following to download the app files.
```
git clone https://github.com/XiXiaPdx/ng-club-manager.git
```
*  #### get into the app folder
```
cd ng-club-manager
```
*  #### install node dependencies
```
npm install
```

* #### You need a Firebase account. Make an api-keys file to store your Firebase api.  Follow the directions at [this link](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/javascript/angular-extended/firebase-introduction-and-setup) to do that.

* #### initiate the local server
```
ng serve
```

* #### once it compiles, open a browser and go to http://localhost:4200/

* #### Assuming your firebase starts out empty, start adding students.


## Further Exploration
